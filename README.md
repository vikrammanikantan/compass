***FAQ***

**Do we have to pay anything to attend this workshop?**
No. The workshop is free

**Will I need to have a machine running Linux?**
Yes, please see above.

**Is it a problem if I have to miss a day?**
It's not a problem if you have to leave, but if you miss material you probably won't be able to follow the rest of the workshop. We will record the sessions and send you the links, so you can watch them and catch up with the rest of the group.

**Will I have to download any software before hand? Is this a 2 days workshop or a 2 choose 1 day class?**
It depends on what operating system you have on your machine. Please see above.

**Would it be possible to still receive the notes from the workshop even if we cannot attend the Zoom?**
Yes, we will provide over email whatever notes we have.
